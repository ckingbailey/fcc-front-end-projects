<!--this row contains the blurb about the artist-->
<div class="row">
<div class="small-12 column">
<p>Nina Katchadourian is a conceptual artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Her work comprises photography, video, sculpture, and public interventions such as a fleet of cars dispersed throughout Brooklyn whose horns make bird calls. She often uses mundane, commonplace materials in her sculpture and photography, elevating the banal through close examination to the level of the sublime. Much of her art relies on humor to draw the viewer in, only to reveal a quiet contemplativeness and a reverence for life’s unregarded moments. Common themes in her art include travel, tacky facsimiles of conventionally beautiful objects, absurdist repairs or improvements to the natural world, and revealing hidden meaning where there in fact may be none.
<br>Katchadourian came to popular attention in 2010 with her YouTube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpfbbolyOKY" target="_blank">Skymall Kitties</a>. More recently she participated in the Armenian Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale, which won the Golden Lion Award for National Participation, and contributed to Creative Time, a series of art installations in New York’s Central Park in summer 2015. She has been an artist-in-residence at San Francisco’s Exploratorium since 2013 and is currently working on a project for the museum.
